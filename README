Limelight Networks Programming Test

Congratulations. You are a strong candidate and we would like to see what you can do. 
You have two hours from the time you receive this test to complete and return it, 
based on email time stamps.

This challenge contains a problem description and some requirements for the 
implementation. Please read the description and requirements carefully. 
Here's how your solution will be evaluated, in priority order (1 is highest priority):

1. Does the program have your name included in a comment?
2. Does the program compile and execute according to the problem description?
3. Does the program exhibit good design techniques?
4. Do you use data structures and algorithms that would allow your program to work
5. Is your code well formatted and easy to read? Do you have sufficient comments? Can
6. Have you thoroughly tested all possible input combinations?

Please write your code in Python, Perl, BASH, C/C++, Ruby, Java.

Thanks and good luck!



Problem Description: Package Installation and System Dependencies

Dependencies between software packages are common in any Unix/Linux system. 
This means that to install a given software package, another package must be
installed beforehand. Additionally lower level software components are often required 
by multiple upper level packages. 

For example, both the telnet client program and the ftp client program require 
the TCP/IP networking package. Conversely, the TCP/IP package cannot be removed until 
all packages that depend on it (telnet, ftp) are removed.

We want you to design and write a program to automate the process of adding and removing
software packages. To do this you will need to:

1. Maintain a record of installed packages and their dependencies.
2. Support explicitly installing a package in response to a command (unless it is already
   installed).
3. Support implicitly installing a package if it is needed to install another package.
4. Support explicitly removing a package in response to a command (if it is not needed to
   support other packages).
5. Support implicitly removing a package if it is no longer needed to support 
   another component.
   
   
   
   
 Requirements

--Before installing a package, automatically install all the packages it requires.
--Before removing a package, confirm that no other packages require it. 
  Dependent packages must be removed manually before the package can be removed.

Input

The input received by your program will contain a sequence of commands, each on a 
separate line, containing no more than eighty characters. The command names 
(DEPEND, INSTALL,REMOVE, and LIST) always appear in uppercase starting in column one 
and the command line separator is one or more spaces. All appropriate DEPEND commands 
will appear before the occurrence of any INSTALL dependencies. 
The end of the input is marked by a line containing only the word END.


 
 Command Syntax:
 
DEPEND item1 item2 
Package item1 depends on package item2 (and item3 or any additional [item3] packages).


INSTALL item1 
Installs item1 and any other packages required by item1.

REMOVE item1 
Removes item1 and, if possible, packages required by item1.

LIST 
Lists the names of all currently installed packages.

END 
Marks the end of input, when used in a line by itself.


Output
1. Echo each line of input.
2. Follow each echoed INSTALL or REMOVE line with the actions taken in response,
   making certain that the actions are given in the proper order.
3. For the LIST command, display the names of the components currently installed.
4. For the DEPEND and END commands, no output, except the echo, is produced.
5. For the DEPEND command, there will only be one dependency list per item.
